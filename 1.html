        <h1>Basic Terms in Adobe After Effects</h1>

        <div id="composition">
            <h2>1) Composition (Comp):</h2>
            <p>A container that holds layers, where you arrange and animate your media elements. Compositions can be nested within other compositions.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="layer">
            <h2>2) Layer:</h2>
            <p>An individual element within a composition, such as text, images, videos, or shapes. Layers can be stacked and manipulated independently.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="timeline">
            <h2>3) Timeline:</h2>
            <p>The panel where you control the timing and sequencing of layers within a composition. It shows the duration of your composition and allows you to animate properties over time.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="keyframe">
            <h2>4) Keyframe:</h2>
            <p>A marker used to define the start and end points of a transition or animation. Keyframes are used to animate properties such as position, scale, and opacity.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="effect">
            <h2>5) Effect:</h2>
            <p>A pre-built or custom filter applied to layers to alter their appearance or behavior. Effects can be used to create animations, apply color corrections, and more.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="precomposition">
            <h2>6) Precomposition:</h2>
            <p>A technique where you group multiple layers into a single composition. This is useful for managing complex scenes and reusing compositions.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="mask">
            <h2>7) Mask:</h2>
            <p>A shape or path used to hide or reveal parts of a layer. Masks can be used to create effects like vignettes or to animate specific areas of a layer.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="rendering">
            <h2>8) Rendering:</h2>
            <p>The process of exporting your composition to a final video file format. Rendering combines all the layers and effects into a single video output.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="footage">
            <h2>9) Footage:</h2>
            <p>The raw media files (such as video clips, images, or audio) imported into After Effects for use in compositions.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="animation_presets">
            <h2>10) Animation Preset:</h2>
            <p>A pre-configured set of animation settings that can be applied to layers to quickly create specific animations or effects.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="expressions">
            <h2>11) Expressions:</h2>
            <p>Scripts written in JavaScript that automate animations and effects. Expressions can link properties, create complex animations, and respond to user input.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="adjustment_layer">
            <h2>12) Adjustment Layer:</h2>
            <p>A layer that applies effects to all layers below it in the composition. Adjustment layers are useful for applying global effects like color grading.</p>
