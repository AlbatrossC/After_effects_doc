# After Effects Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains notes and documentation that I'm creating as I learn Adobe After Effects. The goal is to make it easier for others to learn from my experiences with the software.

## About Me

I'm currently focused on learning After Effects and documenting everything in text format so others can follow along. At the same time, I'm also studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, starting with HTML. This combination is not only helping me learn motion graphics but also enhancing my web development skills.

Feel free to explore, use, or contribute to this project!
